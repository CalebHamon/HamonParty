# HamonParty
Executing the code will give prompts to plan your party!
Though some people are already invited, 90 of 100 in fact.
These people will be placed in tables by different companies, no more than one rep from each company.
You will have the ability to add a guest when prompted.
The add will ask for the first and last name and also the company from which the person is from.
These will be passed as objects to be added to an arraylist to then be accessed later to then add to a table.
It will automatically add to a table, where the code will check what table is available, then add you to a roster of that table if it does return a table number
if it does not then you will be automatically removed from the system
Afterwards you can see a guestlist by who is at each table and who is at each company by running through the rosters
Finally, you can look someone up by last name.
The code will do a sequential search that will go from table roster 1 to 10. When found it will return that person's full name, table and seat number
